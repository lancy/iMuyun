OpenTok iOS SDK
===============

This package contains what you need to get you started using the OpenTok iOS SDK.

The OpenTok iOS SDK lets you use OpenTok video sessions in apps you build for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch devices.
This means you can use OpenTok video sessions that connect iOS users with each other and with web clients.
For information on OpenTok, see http://www.tokbox.com/.

Documentation of the SDK is available here: 

http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/ios/docs/index.html

See the topic on "Getting Started with the OpenTok iOS SDK."

Also, look at the OpenTokHelloWorld sample in the sample directory. This is the simplest sample app. Then look at the OpenTokBasic sample, which uses more of the API. These sample apps are also at GitHub:

April 23, 2012

* Fixed a bug where the aspect ratio for publishers was incorrect at certain orientations.
* Improved average connection time for subscribers. Delegates should receive the [OTSubscriberDelegate subscriberVideoDataReceived:] message a bit faster.

April 5, 2012

* [OTPublisher cameraPosition] -- The preferred camera position. When setting this property, if the change is possible, the publisher will use the camera
with the specified position. If the publisher has begun publishing, getting this property returns the current camera position; if the publisher has not yet
begun publishing, getting this property returns the preferred camera position. Valid values are defined in the AVCaptureDevicePosition enum.
